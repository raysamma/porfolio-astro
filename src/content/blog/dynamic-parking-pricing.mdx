# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Capstone Project – Summer Analytics 2025**

This project implements an intelligent dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots, adjusting parking rates in real-time based on demand, queue lengths, traffic conditions, and competitor prices.

The solution uses real-time data streaming with Pathway and visualizes price fluctuations using interactive Bokeh plots.

## 🌟 Overview

Urban parking spaces are limited and static pricing often leads to underutilization or overcrowding. This project solves that problem by:

- 📈 Increasing prices during high demand and traffic
- 📉 Reducing prices when occupancy is low
- 🗺️ Considering competitor prices and proximity to suggest rerouting
- 🔄 Streaming real-time data to update prices dynamically

We built three pricing models, progressively improving intelligence:
- Baseline Linear Model
- Demand-Based Price Function
- Competitive Pricing Model

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component           | Details                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Language            | Python 3                      |
| Data Processing     | Pandas, NumPy                 |
| Real-Time Streaming | Pathway                       |
| Visualization       | Bokeh, Panel                  |
| Hosting/Sharing     | Google Colab, GitHub          |
| Geospatial Analysis | Latitude/Longitude proximity  |

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Input data (`dataset.csv`) includes occupancy, capacity, traffic, queue lengths, and GPS for 14 lots.
- Simulated real-time ingestion using `Pathway.demo.replay_csv()`.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Parse timestamp, calculate occupancy ratio and demand metrics.
- Extract day-level and lot-level features.

### 3️⃣ Pricing Models
- **Model 1:** Simple linear pricing
  ```python
  price_t+1 = price_t + α * (Occupancy / Capacity)
  ```
- **Model 2:** Demand-based pricing using:
  - Occupancy Rate
  - Queue Length
  - Traffic Level
  - Special Day Indicator
  - Vehicle Type Weightage
- **Model 3:** Adds competitor prices and rerouting logic.

### 4️⃣ Real-Time Visualization
- Plot dynamic prices over time using Bokeh interactive charts.
- Simulate price updates and recommendations live.

## 📝 Documentation

### ✨ Features
- Smooth price transitions (avoids erratic jumps)
- Handles high-demand and low-capacity scenarios gracefully
- Reroutes vehicles to nearby lots if occupancy is high

### 🔥 Challenges Solved
- Simulating real-time streams in Colab
- Normalizing demand and keeping prices bounded between 0.5x and 2x base price
- Integrating geospatial logic with pricing

## 🚀 How to Run

- Open in Google Colab
- Upload `dataset.csv`
- Run all cells to start real-time simulation
