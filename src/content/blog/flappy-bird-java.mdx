# Flappy Bird — Java Swing Edition

A simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java Swing. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts like animation, collision detection, event handling, and GUI rendering.

## 🖥️ Preview

2D game window with a bird flapping between pipes while the player tries to avoid hitting them.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
/flappy-bird
├── App.java               // Main game launcher class
├── FlappyBird.java        // Game logic, rendering, and user interaction
├── flappybird.png         // Bird sprite
├── flappybirdbg.png       // Background image
├── toppipe.png            // Top pipe image
└── bottompipe.png         // Bottom pipe image
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Requirements**
- JDK 8 or later
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) or terminal

**How to Run**
```sh
javac App.java FlappyBird.java
java App
```
Make sure all the image files are placed in the same directory as your .java files or adjust the getResource(...) paths accordingly.

## 🎮 Game Controls

- SPACEBAR → Makes the bird flap (jump upward).
- If the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen, Game Over is displayed.
- Press SPACEBAR again to restart after a game over.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- **Java Swing GUI**: JFrame & JPanel for rendering the game window, ImageIcon for loading images, KeyListener for detecting user input.
- **Game Loop**: javax.swing.Timer runs at ~60 FPS (1000/60 ms interval), Pipe generation every 1500 ms.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Bird and Pipe classes are defined as inner classes for structure and encapsulation.
- **Collision Detection**: Simple rectangular bounding box logic:
  ```
  a.x < b.x + b.width &&
  a.x + a.width > b.x &&
  a.y < b.y + b.height &&
  a.y + a.height > b.y
  ```



## 📌 TODO / Improvements

- Add sound effects
- Add start/pause menus
- Optimize image loading
- Track high scores
- Mobile compatibility with JavaFX
